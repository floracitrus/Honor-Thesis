## Abstract
Continuous time series data records in relational networks can be modelled to understand the characteristics of latent group communications and underlying mechanisms. These models can flexibly describe latent group allocations and the self-exciting, mutually- exciting features between the clusters by, combining a stochastic block model with the Hawkes process. This thesis demonstrates this by initially implementing a Hawkes model, then gradually refining that to a Poisson stochastic block model and then finally to the reciprocal Hawkes stochastic block model which were tested on generated datasets and real world datasets with the Poisson stochastic block model. This will be achieved by simulating generative models and then presenting a Bayesian inference procedure consisting of a combination of efficient Gibbs and adaptive Metropolis-Hasting sampler steps.
